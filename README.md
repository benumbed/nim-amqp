# Nim AMQP Library
**IN PROGRESS** -- This library is not ready for use yet, it's still being written.  I'm writing this as my first project for Nim, and doing so directly from the AMQP 0-9-1 spec, so it's taking a while :).

AMQP implementation in Nim.  NOTE: This currently only supports pure AMQP 0-9-1.
